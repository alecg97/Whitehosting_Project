# 🏡 Whitehosting Project – Real Estate Data & AI Exploration

**Whitehosting** is a UK-based company specializing in investment in vacation properties. In the post-COVID context, the company is considering an investment of **300 million euros** in the Spanish real estate market, focusing specifically on **Barcelona, Madrid, and Valencia**, where it already has prior experience.

To make an informed decision about this investment, the company posed a series of key questions that required in-depth data analysis. As a starting point, a dataset of the Spanish market was provided, along with instructions to carry out **web scraping** from the well-known platform **Airbnb**.

## 📊 Project Objective

The project is developed in **two main phases**:

### 1. 🧪 Data Analysis

This first phase aims to answer the company’s questions through an analytical approach that includes:

- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on:
  - The dataset provided by Whitehosting.
  - The data obtained through Airbnb scraping.

- 🌐 **Web Scraping** of Airbnb to gather key information about the published listings.

- 🧹 **Cleaning and transformation** of both datasets, followed by their **unification** into a consolidated, structured, and analysis-ready dataset.

- 🗃️ **Design of a relational database in MySQL**, defining the various tables, data types, and relationships. Sample data entries were also added to test the structure and support future SQL queries.

- 📊 **Visualization of results** using **Power BI**, enabling a visual and executive-level interpretation of the findings.

### 2. 🤖 Data Science & Artificial Intelligence

The second phase focuses on advanced **Machine Learning** and **Generative AI** techniques to enrich the analysis:

- 📈 Development of **regression models** capable of predicting the **price per night** of a property based on its features.

- 🧠 Use of **generative AI** to **augment context** and expand available data using reviews and simulated entries.
